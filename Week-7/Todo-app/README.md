# Todo Backend API

This is a Todo backend API built using Node.js, Mongoose for MongoDB interactions, and various other technologies to provide robust functionality such as authentication, validation, and password encryption.

## Features

- **Node.js & Express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework.
- **Mongoose**: Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **JWT Authentication**: Implemented JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication for securing the API routes.
- **Zod & Mongoose Validation**: Validation using Zod for API requests and Mongoose as the schema builder and validator.
- **Bcrypt**: Used for encrypting and securely storing passwords.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- JWT for authentication
- Zod for validation
- Bcrypt for password encryption

## Routes

The routes are protected by authentication middleware, and hereâ€™s a list of the main endpoints

### Route Details

- `GET /addTodo`: Adds a new todo (authentication required).
- `GET /fetchTodo/:id`: Fetch a single todo by its ID (authentication required).
- `GET /fetchTodos`: Fetch all todos for the authenticated user (authentication required).
- `PUT /updateTodo/:id`: Updates a todo by its ID (authentication required).
- `DELETE /deleteTodo/:id`: Deletes a todo by its ID (authentication required).

## Authentication

The application uses JWT for authentication. Upon successful login, the user is given a token, which must be included in the headers of requests to protected routes:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Validation

Zod is used to validate request bodies, ensuring that they meet the required schema. Mongoose also enforces schema validation at the database level.

## Password Encryption

Passwords are encrypted using Bcrypt before being stored in the database to ensure user security.
